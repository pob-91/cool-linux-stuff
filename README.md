# cool-linux-stuff

A collection of useful things for the Linux desktop user.

### Intro

This repository is designed for people who are interested in using Linux as their main workstation with a graphical user interface. Some setups are harder than others and there are usually some gotchas especially when transitioning for the first time. Here you will find collections of scripts, dorfiles and instructions dedicated to different flavours and setups. 

Some sections will be thorough and quite complete whilst others may have significant chunks missing or require tweaks to make work.

### Target Audience

This is aimed at people who may be less experienced with Linux or configuring systems at a deeper level. Whilst no knowledge of computer systems or programming is required, it may be useful in some instances.

Experienced Linux users who just want to get config references e.t.c. should also find this useful.

### Motivations

I really like using Linux for lots of reasons, however, it can be a bit of a rabbit hole and put people off using it. This repository should make it easier for people to adopt Linux.

I also need a place to keep my files :)

### Organisation

In this directory you will find some overview files and general intros into different areas.

There will then be subdirectories dedicated to a particular flavour or setup. In these folders you should find at least one README which takes you through setup and tweaks to get things working. You will also usually find a `.config` folder that contains dotfiles dedicated to that setup.

You will also notice some repetition and overlap in configurations. This is purposeful as sometimes different systems or setups reqiuire small changes in the same tool.
