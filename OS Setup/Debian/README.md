# Debian

Debian is one of the OGs of Linux and is know for its stability. It uses an LTS Linux kernel so you should pick this over others if you need reliability above all else. 

Debian installation is pretty simple as there is a console based GUI that takes the user through the install. However, this is "out of the box" installation. For a more advanced installation including btrfs and encryption see [the advanced guide](./ADVANCED.md).

## Getting the ISO

Get the latest ISO and create a boot USB [from here](https://www.debian.org/download).

## Full Install

The installer has a **Graphical Install** option that you can folow for path of least resistance.

## Minimal Install

If you want to do a minimal install and then customise it how you want (my preferred route), then perform the install via the **Advanced Options**. For more info [see here](./ADVANCED.md).
