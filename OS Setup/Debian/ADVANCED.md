# Advanced Debian Installation

In this README we will install a minimal version of Debian with no GUI that can be build upon for custom setup.

In this section we are also going to configure btrfs and encryption, however these parts can be skipped if you want.

## Installation

To start go to the **Advanced Options** and then **Expert Install**.

Follow through the items on the list.

When you get to selecting which installation modules to load make sure to check the crypto option.
