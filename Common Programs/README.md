# Common Programs

This section will list out some common and useful programs that you may want to install after you have completed a graphical setup.

## Volume Icon

A volume icon system tray. Search `volumeicon` in your package manager.

## Dictionaries & Spelling

Use `hunspell` and `hunspell-en_GB` for eaxmple if you want British spelling.

## Screen Layouts

In Xorg look at using `arandr` and for Wayland look at `wdisplays`.

## Wallpapers

There is a Wallpapers folder in this repo that you can use to get started.

## Emails

There are many email clients for Linux but my current favourite that is simmilar to Outlook is `thunderbird`.

## File Manager

Again, there are many good ones for this, however my suggestion is to use `thunar`. A complete setup of thunar includes:

```
thunar tumbler ffmpegthumbnailer thunar-archive-plugin file-roller
```

You'll also want some compression algorithms and a virtual file system to power the trash can like `gvfs`.

## Document Viewer

I use eye of gnome: `eog`.

## Office Software

Libreoffice is a good choice, choose the `fresh` branch.

## Music

Yep, Spotify works on Linux.

## Password Manager

Bitwarden is probably the best.

## Chat / Work

Slack, Teams and Zoom all work on Linux although Slack is by far the best one here.

## Text Editor

Gnome edit is a good option `gedit`.

## Todo

I use todoist which is available on Linux via an app image `todoist-appimage`.

## PDF Viewer and Editor

Xournal++ is a good one `xournalpp`.

## Calculator

Gnome calculator is good. `gnome-calculator`.

## Battery Management

For laptops you can use `slimbookbattery` along with tlp to manage power consumtion and performance.

## Screenshots

For Wayland use `grim`, `slurp` and `swappy` in conjunction.

For Xorg look at `scrot`.

## Fonts

You want a wide selection of fonts installed to have a good experience. Look at paratype fonts and font awesome as well as liberation fonts.
